# Pebble Time Color Palette for OS X

A color palette for use with the OS X color picker containing all of the colors usable
with the Pebble Time. This list was generated by scraping the [Pebble Time Color Picker Tool](http://developer.getpebble.com/tools/color-picker/).

The scripts used to generate the file are also included in the repo and require:
 - ruby 1.9 to scrape color data
 - xcode to generate the .clr file
